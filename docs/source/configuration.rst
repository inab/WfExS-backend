Configuration 
=============

WfExS software needs at least two and sometimes three different input confguration files 
to run your workflow:

- :ref:`Local configuration<local_config>` file (**required!**)
- :ref:`Workflow staging configuration<wf_stage_config>` file (**required!**)
- :ref:`Security contexts<secure_config>` file (optional)

.. index::
   single: configuration; local-config

Keep in mind that any workflow/situation is different, so we cannot give you an 
exact manual on what to do here. Configuration files will need to be filled adapting to each 
workflow execution needs.

.. _local_config:

Local configuration
-------------------

WfExS needs a local installation configuration file. This is a YAML (``.yaml`` / ``.yml``) 
formatted file which describes the local setup of the backend. 
JSON Schema describing the format (and used for validation) is available at 
`wfexs_backend/schemas/config.json <https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend/blob/main/wfexs_backend/schemas/config.json>`_. 
Automatically generated documentation is also available 
(see `config_schema.md <https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend/blob/main/development-docs/schemas/config_schema.md>`_).

An initial local configuration can be generated by running the following command in
an empty directory: 

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir ${CONFIG_DIR}
   python WfExS-backend.py -L ${CONFIG_DIR}/local_config_${USER}.yaml init --cache-dir ....
   
.. list-table::

   * - ``init``
     - This command is used to initialize a WfExS installation. It takes a local configuration
       file through **-L** parameter, and it can both generate crypt4gh paired keys for installation 
       work and identification purposes and update the path to them in case they are not properly 
       defined. Those keys are needed to decrypt encrypted working directories, and in the future
       to decrypt secure requests and encrypt secure results.

This will genarte the local configuration file as well as the encryption keys.
The first time you run WfExS the new encryption keys will be made in those files.

.. note:: 
   ``python WfExS-backend.py --init``
   will generate default local configuration file and ecryption keys in the 
   current directory.
   ``wfexs_config.yml``, ``wfexs_config.yml.key``, ``wfexs_config.yml.pub``  
  

An example of a local configuration file:

.. code-block:: bash

   cacheDir: ../wfexs-backend-test
   crypt4gh:
      key: local_config.yaml.key
      passphrase: strive backyard dividing gumball
      pub: local_config.yaml.pub
   tools:
      dockerCommand: docker
   encrypted_fs:
      type: encfs
      command: encfs
   engineMode: local
   gitCommand: git
   javaCommand: java
   singularityCommand: singularity
   staticBashCommand: bash-linux-x86_64
   workDir: ../wfexs-backend-test_WorkDir

.. note::
    Relative paths in this configuration file use as reference the directory where 
    the local configuration file is living.

More extensive examples are available at `workflow_examples/ <https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend/tree/main/workflow_examples>`_. 

Plese fill the local configuration file according to your workflow needs.

Main local configuration parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Description of main local configuration parameters. More detailed information can be found 
`here <https://github.com/paulaidt/WfExS-backend?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-files>`_.
.. list-table::

   * - ``cacheDir``
     - The path in this key sets up the place where all the contents which can be cached are hold. 
       It contains downloaded RO-Crate, workflow git repositories, workflow engines. 
       It is recommended to have it outside /tmp directory when Singularity is being used, 
       due undesirable side interactions with the way workflow engines use Singularity.
   * - ``workDir``
     - The path in this key sets up the place where all the executions are going to store both 
       intermediate and final results, having a separate directory for each execution. 
       It is recommended to have it outside /tmp directory when Singularity is being used, 
       due undesirable side interactions with the way workflow engines use Singularity.
   * - crypt4gh.key
     - The path to the secret key used in this installation. It is paired to ``crypt4gh.pub``.
   * - crypt4gh.pub
     - The path to the public key used in this installation. It is paired to ``crypt4gh.key``.
   * - crypt4gh.passphrase
     - The passphrase needed to decrypt the contents of ``crypt4gh.key``.
   * - tools.engineMode
     - Currently, local mode only.
   * - tools.containerType
     - Currently, singularity, docker or podman.
   * - tools.gitCommand
     - Path to ``git`` command (only used when needed).
   * - tools.dockerCommand
     - Path to ``docker`` command (only used when needed).
   * - tools.singularityCommand
     - Path to ``singularity`` command (only used when needed).
   * - tools.javaCommand
     - Path to ``java`` command (only used when needed).

.. _wf_stage_config:

Workflow staging configuration
-------------------------------

Here, we describe how to make your own workflow configuration file. This is a
``YAML`` formatted file which describes the workflow staging before being executed:
where inputs are located and can be fetched, the security contexts to be used 
on specific inputs to get those controlled access resources, the parameters, 
the outputs to capture, etc.

* ``JSON`` Schema describing the format and valid keys (and used for validation), 
is available at `wfexs_backend/schemas/stage-definition.json <https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend/blob/main/wfexs_backend/schemas/stage-definition.json>`_ 
and there is also automatically generated documentation (see `stage-definition_schema.md <https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend/blob/main/development-docs/schemas/stage-definition_schema.md>`_).

Generate a staging config file:

.. code-block:: bash

    touch ${CONFIG_DIR}/${WORKFLOW_NAME}_wfex.stage

Minimum example template to fill in your ``${WORKFLOW_NAME}_wfex.stage`` file:

.. code-block:: bash

    workflow_id: #URL to workflow
    workflow_config:
        secure: true / false
        containerType: docker / podman / singularity / none
    cacheDir: /path/to/chacheDir
    crypt4gh:
        key: /path/to/private-key
        passphrase: four random words here
        pub: /path/to/public-key
    params:
    ...
    outputs:
    ...

The lines after ``params`` are used to describe the input files. The ``outputs`` map to the 
expected ``files`` / ``directories`` that come out at the end of the workflow execution.

.. warning::
    Only URLS can be used to define your workflow (i.e. workflow available through 
    `WorkflowHub <https://workflowhub.eu/>`_), input files and references, local files are 
    not yet supported by WfExS.

Plese fill the workflow staging configuration file according to your workflow needs.
You need to know the specific steps which are performed in the workflow you are going to execute. 

    - Define your ``input`` files and the ``references`` which need to be used for each step. 
    - Define your ``outputs`` files. It can be described what the output file type is (this is
      predefined by the workflow itself) and its preferred name.

You can find additional general examples of workflow configuration files on the WfExS GitHub page 
in `workflow_examples <https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend/tree/main/workflow_examples>`_ folder. 
You'll find examples of workflow configuration files (files ending with ``.stage``) tailored 
for both CWL and Nextflow workflows.

.. index::
   single: configuration; security-config

.. _secure_config:

Security contexts file 
----------------------

Some websites require credentials in order to download or access ``input``/ ``reference`` files.
Usernames and passwords credentials for accessing secured files required in 
some steps of the workflow should be added to the ``security contexts file``. 
This is a ``YAML`` formatted file which holds the `user`/ `password` pairs, security tokens 
or keys needed on different steps, like input fetching. 

.. code-block:: bash

    touch ${CONFIG_DIR}/${WORKFLOW_NAME}_wfex.credentials.ctxt

An example of a security contexts file (``${CONFIG_DIR}/${WORKFLOW_NAME}_wfex.credentials.ctxt``):

.. code-block:: bash

    public_broad:
        username: gsapubftp-anonymous
        password: ""

More examples of security context files can be found 
`here <https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend/blob/main/workflow_examples>`_


``JSON`` Schema describing the format and valid keys (and used for validation), 
is available at `wfexs_backend/schemas/security-context.json <https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend/blob/main/wfexs_backend/schemas/security-context.json>`_ 
and there is also automatically generated documentation (see `security-context_schema.md <https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend/blob/main/development-docs/schemas/security-context_schema.md>`_).
