What's Changed



Docker and Singularity container recipes are considered mature enough.

Added GitHub CI workflow to automatically generate a docker image on each new tag.

Added instructions about how to used WfExS-backend in different containerized scenarios (see https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend/blob/1.0.0rc0/WFEXS-in-CONTAINERS.md).

Added "disclosable", "cacheable" and "clonable" flags to parameters from the stage definition. These definitions should tell the orchestrator whether the datasets associated to those input parameters contents can be transferred to generated RO-Crates or exported, whether a copy can be kept in the common cache, or whether a copy can be placed in the working directory.

Now it is allowed to label a dataset cache entry as "clonable" or non "clonable", so it restricts the copies of its contents.

More publications/posters for the README by @stain in https://github.com/inab/WfExS-backend/pull/112

Several documentation and small fixes.

	abstract = {FAIR Computational Workflows argues that workflows should be FAIR scholarly community research objects in their own right as a kind of FAIR Research Software. In this project we go one step further, and argue that workflow executions should also be published with sufficient traces and structured metadata. 

Workflow Run RO-Crate is a set of profiles of RO-Crate that capture workflow provenance in a lightweight FAIR data package based on existing standards, in order to support traceability, reproducibility and interoperable description of diverse computational analysis. This use of RO-Crate allows the contextualization of a computational workflow and its execution, e.g. relating to people, organisations, projects, funding, data sources and wider research questions and studies.

We have implemented the profile in multiple workflow systems, including Galaxy, COMPSs, StreamFlow, WfExS, Sapporo and Autosubmit. The command line tool runcrate can convert from the precursor CWLProv and display or validate crates according to the profiles. The crates are compatible with ELIXIR's WorkflowHub and support increasing levels of details, including documenting ad-hoc scripts without a workflow engine.

WfExS is a workflow orchestrator designed for reproducible and secure workflow executions in isolated environments (like HPC). Every input, workflow and container being used in an execution must have either a public or permanent identifier, or at least a resolvable URI, so the execution scenario can be materialised. The execution scenario before and/or after the execution can be saved to RO-Crate.

Here we bring together FAIR Computational Execution practitioners to mature and generalise this approach using Workflow Run Crate.},

	doi = {10.5281/zenodo.4705078},
	abstract = {The original scope of task 8.3 is to develop metrics to assess the impact on reproducibility of the availability of life-science open data and workflows in the cloud.


A great part of the activities within EOSC-Life is actually related to reproducibility and provides in several ways tools that will have an impact. Therefore, we decided that it would be more informative to describe such activities and to explain why and how they will have an impact on reproducibility in life sciences, instead of providing abstract metrics for such an impact. For these reasons, we changed the title of the deliverable, from “framework to assess ...” to “framework to enhance reproducibility”.


First of all, we reasoned on what can be the contribution of open science to improve the reproducibility of research. Publicly sharing data, protocols, tools and computational workflows makes it possible to compare or combine the data and outcomes from different studies within a discipline as well as integrate data across scientific domains. It allows conclusions to be validated and possibly corrected as well as being reinforced by meta-analyses. Replication data and test/training data can also be used in many applications to contribute to reproducible research. Moreover, new hypotheses, different from the original aims of the study, can be explored. Data sets can be re-used to develop and test new methods, to conduct scientific and technical benchmarking activities and to support training activities. Therefore, in addition to generating more value from research investments, data sharing has the potential to increase confidence in research outcomes and increase knowledge dissemination. These benefits of open sharing have long been recognized in some fields such as bioinformatics, which has a long history of publicly sharing data with, for example, public repositories for nucleotide sequences going back 30 years and the Protein Data Bank (PDB), a repository of information about the 3D structures of proteins, nucleic acids and complex assemblies, that celebrates its 50th birthday this year.


In this notion, any improvement in sharing of data, tools and workflows among scientists and across disciplines, that is the aim of EOSC-Life and the wider EOSC, will contribute to reproducible science. In addition to this general scope, several specific actions to frame transparency in the reporting of experimental protocols, data and analytical workflows warrant the reproducibility of each single object (experimental results, data or workflows) that is made available on the cloud.


We will describe here the initiatives in EOSC-Life to implement existing tools for reproducibility as well as to develop new tools for its enhancement. As the final goal of EOSC-Life is to make data resources available to the wider community of life scientists, although necessarily technical in several points, this document aims at a general readership, including experimental in addition to data scientists.},
