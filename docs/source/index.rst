Welcome to WfExS-backend's documentation!
===================================

**WfExS-backend** (/why'fixes/) is a Python application and set of libraries
which acts as an high-level majordomo in the execution of publically available
workflows which use containers, feeding the inputs with reachable inputs
(either public or under controlled access), in a secure way.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
